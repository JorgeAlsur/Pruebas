		When locking is enabled for a domain, any requests to transfer
		the domain to another registrar or hosting company will
		automatically fail.  This can be used to prevent fraudulent
		transfers of the domain, while locking is enabled.

		<br><br>

		Should you ever want to transfer the domain, or modify
		nameservers based on the domain, domain locking must first be
		disabled, before the relevant action is performed.

		<br><br>

		Note that only the owner for a domain can enable/disable
		locking.  The sub-user for the domain, if any, will not be
		able to perform this action.
