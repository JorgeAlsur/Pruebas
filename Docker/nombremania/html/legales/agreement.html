                <ol>

                  <li><strong>IN THIS REGISTRATION AGREEMENT</strong> ("Agreement"), is between Tucows Domains Inc. ("Tucows") and you, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent ("Registrant"), as offered through ___________________________________, the Reseller participating in Tucows' distribution channel for domain name registrations. Any reference to "Registry" or "Registry Operator" shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain ("TLD"). This Agreement explains Tucows' obligations to Registrant, and Registrant's obligations to Tucows, for the domain registration services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Registrant agrees to be bound by the rules and regulations set forth in this Agreement, and by a registry for that particular TLD.</li>



                  <li><strong>DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.</strong> Domain name registrations are for a limited term, which ends on the expiration date communicated to the Registrant. A domain name submitted through Tucows will be deemed active when the relevant registry accepts the Registrant's application and activates Registrant's domain name registration or renewal. Tucows cannot guarantee that Registrant will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of application. Tucows is not responsible for any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or renewal process.</li>



                  <li><strong>FEES.</strong> Registrant agrees to pay Reseller the applicable service fees prior to the registration or renewal of a domain. All fees payable hereunder are non-refundable even if Registrant's domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term.</li>



                  <li><strong>TERM.</strong> This Agreement will remain in effect during the term of the domain name registration as selected, recorded and paid for at the time of registration or renewal. Should the domain name be transferred to another registrar, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall cease.</li>



                  <li><strong>EXPIRATION, RENEWAL AND FORFEITURE.</strong> The registered domain name will expire on the expiration date specified in the registration term, and as communicated to the Registrant. Registrant will receive reminders immediately prior to the expiration inviting Registrant to renew the domain name. In the event that Registrant fails to renew the domain name in a timely fashion, the registration will expire and Tucows may, at its discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it in its own account, delete it, or sell it to a third party. During the period following the expiration of a domain name, the domain name will cease to resolve, the Whois registration records may be revised to include that of Tucows or its reseller, and visitors to Registrant's website may be directed to a default web page. This default web page may feature advertisements posted by Tucows for its own account. Registrant acknowledges and agrees that Registrant's right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration. Registrant is solely responsible for informing itself of the date of expiration and renewing its registration in a timely manner. If Tucows, in its sole discretion, elects to renew the registration, Registrant will be entitled to a grace period of forty (40) days during which Registrant may re-register the domain name. Additional costs for the redemption and re-registration will apply.</li>



                  <li><strong>EXPIRED REGISTRATION RECOVERY POLICY</strong> Domain expiration notices will be sent via email thirty (30) days and five (5) days prior to a domain expiration date and three (3) days after a domain expires. Renewal, post-expiration renewal and redemptions fees are published at <a href="https://opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing/">https://opensrs.com/services/domains/domain-pricing/</a>. Reseller's fees may differ.</li>



                  <li><strong>REGISTRANT INFORMATION.</strong> Registrant must provide the following information as part of the domain name registration process, and promptly correct and update during the term of the registration:

                    <ol type="a">

                      <li>Name and postal address of the Registered Name Holder;</li>

                      <li>Registered name;</li>

                      <li>Names of the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the Registered Name;</li>

                      <li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the administrative contact for the domain name;</li>

                      <li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the billing contact for the domain name; and </li>

                      <li>Name, postal address, e-mail address, and voice and fax (if available) telephone numbers of the technical contact for the domain name.</li>

                    </ol>

                  </li>



                  <li><strong>ACCURATE INFORMATION.</strong> Registrant represents and warrants that:

                    <ol type="a">

                      <li>The statements that Registrant makes in connection with the domain name registration, maintenance, or renewal are complete and accurate;</li>

                      <li>Registrant information will be kept current;</li>

                      <li>Registrant will not and will not permit others to use the domain name in violation of any ICANN or registry policies, applicable laws or regulations, or legal rights of others;</li>

                      <li>Registrant will respond to inquiries from Tucows addressed to the email address of the Registrant, the administrative, billing or technical contact with respect to a domain name concerning the accuracy of contact details.</li>

                    </ol>

                    Registrant acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will constitute a material breach of the Agreement, which will entitle either Tucows or a registry to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach without any refund and without notice to Registrant.

                  </li>



                  <li><strong>ICANN REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.</strong> Domain name registration requires sharing the Registrant's information, in whole or in part, with the applicable Registry Operator and with ICANN. As required by ICANN, this information must be made publicly available by means of Whois, and the Registry Operator also may be required to make this information publicly available by Whois. Both Tucows and the Registry Operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service. Registrant consents to and gives permission for all such required disclosures. Further, Registrant represents and warrants that, if Registrant is providing information about a third party, Registrant has notified the third party of the required disclosures and the purpose for the disclosures and Registrant has obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure. ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that Tucows may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.</li>



                  <li><strong>SUSPENSION AND CANCELLATION.</strong> Tucows may in its sole discretion, suspend or cancel Registrant's domain name registration:

                    <ol type="a">

                      <li>if Registrant breaches this Agreement;</li>

                      <li>if Registrant fails to provide payment or accurate contact or billing information;</li>

                      <li>in the event there was an error in the registration process for such domain name;</li>

                      <li>as required by ICANN or a Registry Operator;</li>

                      <li>to protect the integrity and stability of Tucows and any applicable registry;</li>

                      <li>to comply with any applicable laws, government rules, requests of law enforcement and court orders;</li>

                      <li>in compliance with any dispute resolution process, or</li>

                      <li>to avoid any liability, civil or criminal.</li>

                    </ol>

                  </li>



                  <li><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</strong> Registrant is bound by all ICANN consensus policies and all policies of any relevant Registry Operator, including the Uniform Rapid Suspension Procedure, The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution policy (UDRP), along with the UDRP rules and all supplemental rules of any UDRP provider. ICANN may change the UDRP at any time. If a third party challenges the registration or reservation of the Registrant's domain name, Registrant will be subject to the provisions specified in the dispute policy adopted by the applicable registry. In the event a domain name dispute arises, Registrant will indemnify and hold Tucows harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable policy. If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding a domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, suspend use of the domain name and the ability to make modifications to the registration records until:

                    <ol type="a">

                      <li>Tucows is directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or</li>

                      <li>Tucows receives notification from both parties that the dispute has been settled.</li>

                    </ol>

                    If Registrant or Registrant's domain name becomes the subject of litigation, Tucows may deposit control of Registrant's domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate.

                  </li>



                  <li><strong>WHOIS PRIVACY SERVICE.</strong> If Registrant elects to use the Whois privacy registration service, the following terms and conditions will apply:

                      <li>Registrant will retain complete control over the domain name and its registration records and may suspend and reinstate the Whois Privacy Service at its discretion.</li>

                      <li>With respect to a domain name that has been transferred to Tucows, the Whois Privacy Service will only commence after the transfer has been completed. If Registrant elects to transfer a domain name to a different registrar, the Whois Privacy Service must be disabled in order to initiate the transfer.</li>

                      <li>Tucows will send all obligatory renewal and transfer related messages to the contacts that Registrant has designated.</li>

                      <li>Pricing for the Whois privacy registration service will be set by the Reseller, and Registrant will pay Reseller for this service.</li>

                  <li><strong>NO GUARANTEE.</strong> Registrant acknowledges that registration of a chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation or use of the domain name.</li>



                  <li><strong>AGENCY.</strong> If Registrant intends to license use of a domain name to a third party, Registrant is deemed the domain name holder of record and is responsible for providing Registrant's own full contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. Registrant shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain name, unless it promptly discloses the licensee's identity and current contact information (as provided by the licensee) to a party providing the Registered Name Holder reasonable evidence of actionable harm.

Your continued use of the registered domain name will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement with any revisions. If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name be cancelled or transferred to a different accredited registrar, and agree that such cancellation or transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement.</li>



                  <li><strong>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</strong> Tucows reserves the right to distribute information to Registrant that is required by ICANN or Registry policy.</li>

Tucows, ICANN and the applicable registries shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.

                  <li><strong>INDEMNITY.</strong> Registrant will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tucows, ICANN, the applicable registries, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors, from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or relating to

                  <li><strong>TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.</strong> The person named as Registrant on the Whois shall be the "Registered Name Holder." The person named as administrative contact at the time the controlling account was secured shall be deemed the designate of the Registrant with the authority to manage the domain name. Registrant agrees that prior to transferring ownership of the domain name to another person (the "Transferee") Registrant shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determine by Tucows in its sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void. Registrant explicitly authorizes Tucows to act as their Designated Agent, as stipulated by the ICANN Transfer Policy, to approve a Change of Registrant on their behalf. </li>



                  <li><strong>BREACH.</strong> Registrant agrees that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP or Dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered by Tucows to be a material breach, and that Tucows may provide written notice, describing the breach, to Registrant. If within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, Registrant fails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to Tucows, that Registrant has not breached its obligations under the Agreement, then Tucows may delete the registration the domain name.

                  <li><strong>INCONSISTENCIES WITH REGISTRY POLICIES.</strong> In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy or procedure of an applicable Registry, the term, condition, policy or procedure of the applicable Registry shall prevail.</li>



                  <li><strong>NON-WAIVER.</strong> Tucows failure to require performance by Registrant of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by Tucows of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.</li>



                  <li><strong>NOTICES.</strong> Any notice, direction or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via e-mail or via regular mail.

                          </li>



                          <li>Registry reserves the right to implement additional anti-spam measures, to block spam or mail from systems with a history of abuse from entering Registry's e-mail forwarding. However, due to the nature of such systems, which actively block messages, Registry shall make public any decision to implement such systems a reasonable time in advance, so as to allow you or us to give feedback on the decision.</li>



                          <li>You understand and agree that Registry may delete material that does not conform to clause (c) above or that in some other way constitutes a misuse of e-mail forwarding. You further understand and agree that Registry is at liberty to block your access to e-mail forwarding if you use e-mail forwarding in a way that contravenes this Agreement. You will be given prior warning of discontinuation of the e-mail forwarding unless it would damage the reputation of Registry or jeopardize the security of Registry or others to do so. Registry reserves the right to immediately discontinue e-mail forwarding without notice if the technical stability of e-mail forwarding is threatened in any way, or if you are in breach of this Agreement. On discontinuing e-mail forwarding, Registry is not obliged to store any contents or to forward unsent e-mail to you or a third party.</li>



                          <li>You understand and agree that to the extent either we and/or Registry is required by law to disclose certain information or material in connection with your e-mail forwarding, either we and/or Registry will do so in accordance with such requirement and without notice to you.</li>

                          <li>If Registrant does not successfully complete the validation process within one year from the date it registers the domain name bundle, the domain name bundle will be deleted and released back into the pool of available domains and any fees paid in connection with the registration of the domain name bundle will be forfeit.</li>

                          <li>Registrant acknowledges and understands that, in the event it is selected for an audit, it will promptly comply with any inquiries and requests from the Registry to provide additional evidence of its NGO status.
